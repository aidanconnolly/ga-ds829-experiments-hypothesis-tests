    "In statistics, **one-way analysis of variance** (abbreviated one-way **ANOVA**) is a technique used to compare means of three or more samples (using the **F distribution**). The **ANOVA** tests the **null hypothesis** (default position that there is no relationship) that samples in two or more groups are drawn from populations with the same mean values. Typically, however, the **one-way ANOVA** is used to test for differences among at least three groups, since the two-group case can be covered by a **t-test**. When there are only two means to compare, the **t-test** and the **F-test** are equivalent.\n",
