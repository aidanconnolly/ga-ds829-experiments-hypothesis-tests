## Learning Objectives

- Explain the difference between causation and correlation
- Determine causality and sampling bias using Directed Acyclic Graphs
- Identify what missing data is and how to handle it
- Test a hypothesis using a sample case study

## Lesson Outline

- Data Source
	- What are the features/covariates/predictors?
	- What is the outcome/response?
	- What do you think each row in the dataset represents?
- Math review
	- Covariance
	- Correlation
	- The variance-covariance matrix
- Causation and Correlation
	- Structure of causal claims
	- Why do we care?
	- How do we determine if something is causal?
- Pearlean Causal DAG model
	- What is a DAG?
	- It's possible that X causes Y.
	- Y causes X.
	- The correlation between X and Y is not statistically significant.
	- X or Y may cause one or the other indirectly through another variable.
	- There is a third common factor that causes both X and Y.
	- Both X and Y cause a third variable and the dataset does not represent that third variable evenly.
	- Controlled Experiments
	- When is it OK to rely on association?
	- How does association relate to causation?
- Sampling bias
	- Forms of sampling bias
	- Problems from sampling bias
	- Recovering from sampling bias
    	- Stratified random sampling
- Missing data
	- Types of missing data
	- De minimis
	- Class imbalance
    	- Relation to machine learning
- Introduction to Hypothesis Testing
	- Validate your findings
	- Confidence intervals
	- Error types
- Scenario
	- Exercises
	- Statistical Tests
	- Interpret your results
